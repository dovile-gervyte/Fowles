               <p n="1" rend="first-line-indent">I do not know why I did what happened next. It was
                  neither intended nor instinctive, it was neither in cold blood nor in hot; but yet
                  it seemed, once committed, a necessary act; no breaking of the commandment. My arm
                  flicked out and slapped her left cheek as hard as it could. The blow caught her
                  completely by surprise, nearly knocked her off balance, and her eyes blinked with
                  the shock; then very slowly she put her left hand to the cheek. We stared wildly
                  at each other for a long moment, in a kind of terror: the world had disappeared
                  and we were falling through space. The abyss might be narrow, but it was
                  bottomless. Behind Alison I could see people stopped on the path. A man stood up
                  from his seat. The Indian sat and watched. Her hand stayed over the side of her
                  face and her eyes were growing wet, certainly with the pain and perhaps partly
                  also with a sort of incredulity.</p>
               <p n="2" rend="first-line-indent">The final truth came to me, as we stood there,
                  trembling, searching, between all our past and all our future; at a moment when
                  the difference between fission and fusion by in a nothing, a tiniest movement,
                  betrayal, further misunderstanding.</p>
               <p n="3" rend="first-line-indent">There were no watching eyes. The windows were as
                  blank as they looked. The theatre was empty. It was not a theatre. They had
                  perhaps told her it was a theatre, and she had believed them, and I <pb n="655"
                  />had believed her. Perhaps it had all been to bring me to this, to give me my
                  last lesson and final ordeal... the task, as in <emph rend="italic"
                     >L'Astrée</emph>, of turning lions and unicorns and magi and other mythical
                  monsters into stone statues. I looked away from Alison and at those distant
                  windows, the façade, the pompous white pedimental figures that crowned it. It was
                  logical, the perfect climax to the godgame. They had absconded, we were alone. I
                  was so sure, and yet... after so much, how could I be perfectly sure? How could
                  they be so cold, so inhuman – so incurious? So load the dice and yet leave the
                  game?</p>
               <p n="4" rend="first-line-indent">I looked back towards the path. The far more
                  natural watchers there were strolling on, as if this trivial little bit of
                  masculine brutality, the promised scene, had lost their interest also. Alison
                  hadn't moved, she still held a hand to her cheek, but now her head was bowed.
                  There was a little shuddered outbreath as she tried to stifle the tears; then her
                  voice, broken, hardly audible, in despair, almost self-amazed.</p>
               <p n="5" rend="first-line-indent"><!-- encode a dialogue?? -->'I hate you. I <emph
                     rend="italic">hate</emph> you.'</p>
               <p n="6" rend="first-line-indent">I said nothing, made no move to touch her. After a
                  moment she looked up and everything in her expression was as it had been in her
                  voice and words: hatred, pain, every female resentment since time began. But I
                  clung to something, the something I had never seen, or always feared to see, in
                  those intense grey eyes, the quintessential something behind all the hating, the
                  hurtness, the tears. A small step poised, a shattered crystal waiting to be
                  reborn. She spoke again, as if to kill what I was looking at.</p>
               <p n="7" rend="first-line-indent">'I <emph rend="italic">do</emph>.'</p>
               <p n="8" rend="first-line-indent">'Then why wouldn't you let me walk away?'</p>
               <p n="9" rend="first-line-indent">She shook her abruptly lowered head, as if the
                  question was unfair.</p>
               <p n="10" rend="first-line-indent">'You know why.'</p>
               <p n="11" rend="first-line-indent">'No.'</p>
               <p n="12" rend="first-line-indent">'I knew within two seconds of seeing you.'</p>
               <p n="13" rend="first-line-indent">I went closer. Her other hand went to her face, as
                  if I might hit her again. <!-- dialogue coding?? <said who=""></said> -->'I understand that word now,
                  Alison. Your word.' Still she waited, face hidden in her hands, like someone being
                  told of a tragic loss. 'You can't hate someone who's really on his knees. Who'll
                  never be more than half a human being without you.'</p>
               <p n="14" rend="first-line-indent">The bowed head, the buried face.</p>
               <pb n="656"/>
               <p n="15" rend="first-line-indent">She is silent, she will never speak, never
                  forgive, never reach a hand, never leave this frozen present tense. All waits,
                  suspended. Suspend the autumn trees, the autumn sky, anonymous people. A
                  blackbird, poor fool, sings out of season from the willows by the lake. A flight
                  of pigeons over the houses; fragments of freedom, hazard, an anagram made flesh.
                  And somewhere the stinging smell of burning leaves.</p>
